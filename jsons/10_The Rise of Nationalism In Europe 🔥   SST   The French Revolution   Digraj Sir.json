  "full_text": "This is the topic of the year, I will get my moustache cut if I don't get the 5th question in this year's board exam There is a sure shot that the question is going to come in the exam French division in the idea of nation Mark this as a star, why? Because you get a direct question from here Keep the book with you NCIT And understand the entire flow from NCIT It's your brother's responsibility to get this idea of liberty, equality, justice. These ideas of democratic government should spread in the whole of Europe. Ok. Let's leak it. I will explain this chapter very well. I will tell 8-10 topics in this chapter on which you have to get short questions in the exam. Okay, let's leak it. So what is the story of the French Revolution? I am explaining the whole essence in one line. What happens in 1748? The revolution comes in France. The monarch was Louis XVI. People turn Louis XVI. And till now, Monarchs used to have full power There were despotist rules where Monarchs used to do everything according to their will They didn't listen to anyone But when the French Revolution came, it marked one significant thing in the history of mankind It made the French Revolution a watershed event Because for the first time, the people had taken power from the king. So, the transfer of power to people was first observed through the French Revolution. And this transfer of power that we saw, what happened with this, this is the beginning of a new era. In a way, a new era begins when people get power. But now you have to understand, What will happen is that you have freed the country, you have removed the monarchy. Only that will not work. The people of the country will also have to feel united. It's a simple thing. So how will the people of the country feel united? So in France, multiple steps have been taken to create a sense of collective identity. In France, multiple steps were taken, and the question is, what were the different steps taken in France to create a sense of collective identity? Now, people don't come together just by gaining freedom. It's a very deep thing. People don't come together just by gaining freedom. So people didn't come together. So how did they get united in France? To get united in France, they adopted this principle. What was this principle? First of all, the idea of La Petrie and Les Citoyens was introduced. What is the idea of La Petrie and Les Citoyens? There is no Sir or Madam. Okay? So, everyone is a citizen. Okay? means everyone is a citizen of the country, no matter how big or small, everyone is a citizen of the country. Then he brought the concept of fatherland, like we say that India is our motherland. But he said that France is his father, his fatherland, so how will a person feel associated with it? Got it? So how this sense of collective identity was created? So the sense of collective identity was created through the following measures First, the idea of La Petrie and Les Cityons Second, a tricolour flag was introduced Earlier, there was a royal standard flag Have you ever thought about this? Whenever there is a revolution, why are the flags made first? Yes sir, if there is a revolution, the flag will be made first and start fighting. No, the flag has an importance. What? The flag is considered as a symbol. How is it considered as a symbol? All the people standing here, we are all standing for this one symbol. We are all connected to this one symbol. So, what is it? People have a sense of identity. So for that, they removed the formal royal standard flag and introduced a tricolour flag. Third, the state assemblies that used to run, the former state assemblies were abolished. The National Assembly was elected. Formal State Assemblies were abolished and National Assemblies were formed by the people of France. After the end of the State General, the National Assemblies were formed. When the revolution was being fought, some people were martyred and some died. So hymns were composed for them. In a way, songs and songs were composed. And the martyrs who were commemorated on the matrix were presented with flowers. Then what is the centralized administrative system? Which was going on differently in France. Different currencies, different systems of weight and measurement were going on. What did they do by removing everyone? They brought a centralized administrative system. where a system of uniform weight and measurement was set up This is a good thing Then what? Regional dialects were spoken a lot Different languages were spoken So what was done by eliminating different languages? French language was used as a common language What will be spoken in the whole place? One language will be spoken And what will that language be? French Okay, all the regional languages   were finished. Now what is happening? French Revolution happened. After the French Revolution, the idea of   nation came out. The people who tried to make people a nation. Now good thoughts are like fire, they spread. So that happened here too. What? This idea was carried to the whole Europe. In France, there was a Jacobin club, I studied in 9th class. Jacobin clubs started getting established in different countries. There was a French army, French revolutionaries. They thought that it is your brother's responsibility that this idea of liberty, equality, justice, okay? These ideas of democratic government should spread all over Europe. And, when the time came When these ideas were spreading, there was a military general in France, who came to power and came to such a power that he established himself as a dictator in France, okay, so that military general comes to power and he establishes himself as a dictator, so who was that military general, that military general was Napoleon Napoleon Bonaparte Napoleon Bonaparte slowly gradually becomes so powerful that he takes France under his control and becomes the dictator of France So Napoleon ends the civil code of 1804 Now what happens next is when Napoleon becomes powerful over the period of time then after Napoleon's power in 1804 he starts his own empire and a Napoleonic Code was established in France. And this same Napoleonic Code will flourish in the rest of Europe as well. So, what was that Napoleonic Code? So, the Napoleonic Code is also known as the Civil Code of 1804. This Civil Code of 1804 is also a question on this Civil Code of 1804. Question is asked in 3rd and 5th number. What do you understand by Civil Code of 1804? Civil Code of 1804 or what do you understand from the Napoleonic Code of 1804? So, this answer will be made in that too. What? In the Napoleonic Code of 1804, under this code, privileges based on birth were abolished. Okay? Which people got on the basis of birth. If you are born in a king's house, then you will become a king, son. So, S.C. privileges on the basis of birth which Napoleon had abolished as soon as he came so that there is some equality in the society. Napoleon was a good man sir, very good. Then what? Equality before law. He ensured equality before law. It's not that if you are a king, no one will go against you in a case or you are a noble or a clergy. So what is it? privileges based on the birth, finish it, equality before law was established, abolish the feudal system, what is feudal system, earlier there used to be a king, feudal system is called Samantvat, earlier there used to be a king, the king had such a big territory, so the king used to make small parts of his territory, and here there used to be a king Now this small king used to disturb people in the absence of the king according to his own accord. So this feudal system was very problematic. This was very problematic because he used to disturb them. And this small king will trouble the common people So he abolished this feudal system What did he do instead of feudal system? Napoleon said that there will be no king Because all of you will be like administrators of each territory You will be transferred So he brought something like government service If you start making someone else a king, then he will start playing the drums. That was the problem. Okay. So, abolish the feudal system. Fine. Guild restrictions were removed. What do guild restrictions mean? Earlier, traders were not allowed to form a group together. This caused losses to the traders. So, what did Napoleon say? There should be money in the economy So he introduced guild restrictions Guild means the union of traders They had complete freedom to make unions There would be no restrictions on them Trade, transport, communication He brought a uniform system Improved all these things And all these things You must have seen in Bahubali Dev Sinha's father So, what is happening is that all these changes were in the Civil Code of 1804 or what we call the Napoleonic Code. So, if we move forward from here, when Napoleon was so good, then he would have been hanged. Why did they kill Napoleon? Right? This is what happens with a good man. So, if we see, then So, wherever Napoleon conquered the areas, the reaction of the local population to French rule were mixed. So, the people who welcomed Napoleon as the harbinger of liberty in the beginning, that Napoleon has come, he has brought equality, come Napoleon, come, those people understood later. Napoleon is coming, he will bring his army, he will implement the civil code in our country, he will do everything right. But people later understand that at the end we have become Napoleon's slaves. For example, Napoleon took over Switzerland. He slapped the king of Switzerland. The king of Switzerland moved away from there. But now who has Switzerland under? Under Napoleon. Now Switzerland is under Napoleon. So, did people understand later that their initial enthusiasm was, Napoleon, come and kill our king. So, later they understood that after killing our king, now Napoleon has become our king. Okay. The dictatorship of Napoleon has come. So, that's why, the initial enthusiasm, the initial excitement, They turned into hostility. So the people who welcomed Napoleon in the beginning, later the same people started opposing Napoleon. Let's move on. How did the idea of nationalism emerge in diverse Europe? There was so much diversity in Europe. People spoke different languages and cultures in different places. people and they all came together and made a country, how can this happen, so this is the question on which the whole chapter is settled, so if we go ahead, there were two types of people in Europe at that time, one was aristocrats, who were aristocrats, the class used to rule. United by a common way of life that cut across regional division. Okay, what is it? For the purpose of diplomacy, they used to speak a common language like the French language dominated. So whether they are living in Poland, whether they are living in France, whether they are living in Germany, they used to speak French. They used to dominate in Europe. They were often connected by the military ties. They used to get married to each other. often for the purpose of diplomacy means to talk to each other they used to use French as a common language they used to own a large estates I am telling you their traits in parallel to aristocrats there was another section there was another section of people they were known as middle class who is middle class? middle class all of us class population and a middle class. So this has emerged as a middle class, in which you are getting to see industrialists, businessmen, professionals, who were those who were able to study for money. If they were able to study, they understood that these aristocrats are enjoying their privileges by birth without any reason, they are having a lot of fun. So who gave them power to rule over us? This is how they opened their minds after reading. They learned to question. They learned to raise their voice. So when these middle class people came, what did these middle class people do? The aristocrats, raised questions on these aristocrats. And when you raise a question, you get an answer. And it also happens that the answer to middle class questions was an ideology, which is called liberalism. So liberalism is an ideology which is derived from the latin word liber. Liber means free. So this ideology is based on freedom. Freedom from monarchs. Freedom from economic restrictions We will understand this liberalism ideology in two contexts We can say in two dimensions First dimension is political dimension At that time there were kings I am a king, my son is a king, his son is a king, my grandson is a king King, king, king So, this is how the system of Raja Raja Wada used to work. So, there was no government by consent. It's not like if a government is ruling me, then it will be by my will. Liberalism, ideology, politically wants that there should be government by consent. If governments are made, then governments should be made by people's will. How? By the will that we can vote. end to autocracy and the monarchs and aristocrats use their powers blindly their powers should be controlled clerical privileges should be abolished so did you understand this way? that liberalism is a political economic ideology political means that government should be made by consent end to autocracy to abolish democracy, to abolish clerical privileges. So, economically, at that time, the king used to control everything. So, people were not free to trade and earn money. People didn't have that freedom. Economic freedom means, or in economic dimension, liberalism means that there should be freedom of market. State-imposed restrictions. The restrictions imposed by the government should be lifted. Unnecessary taxes should not be imposed. Because they used to stop people to do better. So, this is the same thing. Are we talking about liberty in the political and economic dimension? The same ideology is liberalism. Economic liberalism was the output of the growing middle class. An example of economic liberalism is given here. Now if we move forward, similarly, a step was taken by Pusha towards economic liberalism. What did he do? He made a group of 39 states called Zolverin. This Zolverin, what do you get to see in this Zolverin? The number of currencies used to be 30, so they reduced it to 2. The internal custom duties that required tax, they said that only 1 tax will be required. Now let's come to new conservatism after 1815. I will tell you the story of why conservatism is written after 1815. Napoleon came to power in 1804. Like he brought the Napoleonic Code What he did with the Napoleonic Code In a way, he went to different countries in Europe And started establishing himself Everything was going well This Napoleon What was Napoleon doing to the established kings and queens? He was removing them and establishing himself So, all the kings thought that we have to play the game of Napoleon. So, the monarchs of the ruling class teamed up. How did they team up? So, let me tell you about the perm nations. There is a short trick. Prussia, Austria, Russia, Britain, ok? Parb, Parb is in your class, Parb is in Hindi class, ok? So, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Britain, these 4 countries, these 4 countries come together and surround Napoleon in 1815. When they surround Napoleon and kill him, after killing Napoleon, All these people together form a group All these people form a group And their group is called the group of conservatives Why? Because who were conservatives? This is also taught in class 9 So those people who were of the old ruling class Who were monarchs, who didn't want to change Who wanted to follow the old system But this time the conservatives who saw If change is for good, then why should not we change ourselves? So he saw that if modern changes are making conservatism stronger, like modern bureaucracy etc. If we are getting benefit from the administrative system, then even if Napoleon brought it, we will adopt it. Now when monarchies were coming back to Europe, You said that party is formed. Why? Because they were coming back into the power. So that's why all the conservatives in 1815 after the defeat of Napoleon, they met at Vienna. Where is Vienna, brother? Vienna is the capital of Austria. So they meet in Vienna and sign some agreements. Let's sign the Treaty of Vienna. It is mentioned in the exam again and again. What is the Treaty of Vienna? What were the changes introduced in Europe after 1815? What do you understand by the Treaty of Vienna? You get questions like this. So, remember the Treaty of Vienna. There is a name here. Duke Metternich. Remember this name too. Why? Because this Duke Metternich Duke means Duke Metternich Metternich Metternich Duke Metternich was the prince of Austria and he was the host of the meeting in Vienna because Vienna is in Austria and he was the duke of Austria. And what was the outcome of this meeting? This is what you have to keep in mind. So, if you look at the agreement, there were all these things in the agreement. The agreement was based primarily on undoing all the changes during the Napoleonic War. For example, when Napoleon brought a lot of changes, he removed a lot of monarchs, etc. So, the main aim of this treaty was that, The Bourbon dynasty was restored, Louis XVI was the king of the Bourbon dynasty. France lost its territory. France, which had bloomed in Napoleon's time, was controlled. All the territories that France had won, were taken away from France. After that, a series of states were... A series of states were... set up around France to control its future expansion so that France's further expansion does not have a direct impact on Prussia, Austria, Russia, and Britain. What was the main intention of this treaty? The main intention of this treaty was to restore the monarchies overthrown by Napoleon. As much as Napoleon created chaos, What we have to do is to restore Dhammachokdi. Treaty of Vienna has been signed. Congratulations. This is the 5th question. So be careful. Treaty of Vienna has been signed. Congratulations.eon, they met at Vienna. Where is Vienna, brother? Vienna is the capital of Austria. So they meet in Vienna and sign some agreements. Let's sign the Treaty of Vienna. It is mentioned in the exam again and again. What is the Treaty of Vienna? What were the changes introduced in Europe after 1815? What do you understand by the Treaty of Vienna? You get questions like this. So, remember the Treaty of Vienna. There is a name here. Duke Metternich. Remember this name too. Why?
