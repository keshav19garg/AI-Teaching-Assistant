Who can stop the one who is leaving? Okay, do it. He or she will lose the seat in legislature. Change the party, but now you will lose your seat. Now you won't be an MP or an MLA. You have to sit in the seat of that party. But now you won't be an MP or an MLA. Now you have to fight the elections again. the seat of that place will be destroyed, there will be re-election and what will happen in re-election. If you are winning, then win. If you are the head of the party, then win with the ticket of the other party, so this new law has helped bring defection down and due to this new law, the defection that used to happen that one party left and went to another party, changed the party, so that defection has been reduced. defection can be controlled because people think that I will go but I will not be MPMLA so I will choose money or MPMLA and sometimes it happens that I will go to that party and that party does not give me so much respect, does not give me a ticket, does not give me a chance to fight again, okay, so this law is good but at the same time this has made any dissent even more difficult.

So this is a challenge and for this challenge we have brought solution anti-defection law and in that anti-defection law there is a shortcoming that genuine cases of changing the party are also very difficult because of this law you tried to make things easy but in that there is a loophole like this understood You"} changing the party are also very difficult because of this law you tried to make things easy but in that there is a loophole like this understood You"
