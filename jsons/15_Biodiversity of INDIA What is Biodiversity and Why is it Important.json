  "full_text": "A small insect can spread a big virus... This is the problem in life. We get what we want very easily. We stop valuing it. So what is it? Biodiversity or biological diversity is immensely rich in wildlife and cultivated species. Biodiversity is immensely rich in wildlife and cultivated species, diverse in form and functions, but closely integrated in a system through multiple networks of interdependencies. What is the meaning of biodiversity? Biodiversity means life Diversity means diversity So how much diversity is there in that life? Right? From small insects to big whales So here it is said Diverse form and function of species Biodiversity means That which is immensely Diverse Diverse Diverse Diverse We get to see rich wildlife and vegetation which we get to see different types of animals and plants which are diverse in form and function which are different from each other in their structure and way of working but are closely integrated in a system but have a very close relationship with each other But are closely integrated in a system through multiple networks of interdependencies It means that a fish is very different from a monkey But for an aquatic ecosystem, fish is very important The monkey is very important for the ecosystem A monkey and a human and a fish are all different But they live together in the environment and only then things work A tree and a human are different but the tree gives food to the human and the human plants the tree So, we all, whether it is a plant or an animal We all are diverse in our forms and functions But we are closely integrated How are we closely integrated? Through multiple network of interdependencies We are connected to nature because of our needs. So this is biodiversity. Now if we understand here, then here it is given flora and fauna topic. What does flora mean? Flora means flower. You can write flowers or you can write plant life. but I write plant life plant life and fauna means fauna means you you means human no you means animal human is also an animal so what will happen here plant life animals What do we call animals? We call it fauna If you look around, you will be able to find that there are some animals and plants which are unique in your area In fact, India is one of the world's richest countries in terms of its vast area of biological diversity. magnitude, type, so India is one of those countries where different types of trees, birds, animals, plants are found. There are millions of species in those insects. So this is possibly twice or thrice the number yet to be discovered. You may have realized the importance of these resources in our daily life. These diverse flora and fauna are so well integrated in our daily life that we take these for granted. But because of this, they are under great stress mainly due to the insensitivity to our environment. The importance of Flora and Fauna has been told, there is diversity in India, we have not discovered a lot, our life is so integrated. If you take flora and fauna for granted, then those resources are not going to be the same. They will be depleted. We have to think about conservation of forest and wildlife. Conservation in the background of rapid decline in wildlife population has become essential. Conservation preserves ecological diversity and our life support system, water, air and soil. Conservation is important because it maintains ecological diversity, water, air and soil. It also preserves the genetic diversity of plants and animals. Genetic diversity is important for better growth of species and breeding. Traditional breeds and indigenous species must be protected. Conservation ensures original genetic traits are not lost. Agriculture and fisheries depend on biological diversity. Healthy ecosystems ensure food security. Aquatic biodiversity supports different types of fisheries. Conservation preserves life support systems and genetic diversity. This explains why conservation is important."
