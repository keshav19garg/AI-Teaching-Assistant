That whole story is not given in the book. Do you want to read it? No one will ask you. But I am explaining it to you. What? That the history book you have, out of that, there is a map of two numbers, and from geography, there is a map of three numbers. Understand it well. So, from history, there are two numbers. There is a map of two numbers. In that map, these three points like Champaran-Bihar, Kheda district, Gujarat and Ahmedabad one thing comes out of these three. One thing comes out of these three. So this is a sure shot that one of the three points of the number one map work has to come in one of the three points. I have to come and I have to come, get this written from me today, I will get this moustache pen done, if it does not come, then take care of this, I am also doing the plot, so what you have to keep in mind from the exam perspective is that the idea of Satyagraha, the Satyagraha movement was implemented by Mahatma Gandhi around various places in the country after coming to India In 1917, in Champaran, Bihar, Indigo peasants, the oppressive plantation system was being implemented against Indigo peasants and he succeeded. It was the principle of Satyagraha that we will not beat you, we will just make you realize that you are wrong. After his success in Champaran, Mahatma Gandhi organized a satyagraha to support the peasants of Kheda districts of Gujarat. Gujarat has three points in the map work. One point will be Ahmedabad which is the third point. This is Ahmedabad in 1918. Why did he go there? He went there in support of cotton mill workers. Ahmedabad is done. And I was telling you about Kheda. Now this Kheda, there will be one more Dandi below. Because Dandi is a coastal town, so we will put it on the coast. Now what is yours? Kheda. Kheda in 1917. So this is cotton mill workers, peasants and indigo peasants, there can be a plantation, an operative plantation system, so if you have any questions, you have to keep in mind that what is the story of where, so I will tell you the story of Kheda, the story of Kheda is in the sense that you know that in Champaran, Satyagraha was successfully After the implementation of Satyagraha, Mahatma Gandhi organized Satyagraha in support of the peasants of Kheda district of Gujarat. Do you know what was happening here? There was a crop failure in Gujarat. And there was a plague epidemic. People's crops were spoiled. And the disease was plagued. People died on a large scale. The peasants were not able to pay the revenue, they could not pay the tax, they did not have food to eat, so they paid the tax, the Britishers came and sucked their blood, so what was happening was that the peasants there could not pay the tax, so they wanted that the revenue collection that is happening, the British government is collecting If the struggle is for truth and if the struggle is against injustice, then Satyagraha can be applied. Satyagraha can be applied. and you are doing injustice to Britishers. So, Britishers realized that they were doing wrong. And here, the tax which was being paid to peasants in Kheda, there is also relaxation. Again, the second victory. And what happens in 1918? In 1918, Mahatma Gandhi went to Ahmedabad to organize a Satyagraha movement amongst the Britishers. cotton mill worker. Now see, it was not that we have to struggle only against the Britishers. The point was that where it is going wrong, we have to struggle. So the example of 1918 tells that in 1918, Mahatma Gandhi used to go to Ahmedabad. What was happening in Ahmedabad was that the cotton mill owner, the owner They were Indians, so what were the owners of the cotton mill doing? They were not paying their workers properly, they were doing injustice to their workers. They were harassing the Indians because power tends to corrupt. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. So those owners were harassing the workers. Mahatma Gandhi said that I will fight against the Indians for the workers, I will fight against the Indian owners, so in 1918 Mahatma Gandhi goes to Ahmedabad and there he organizes the Satyagraha movement for cotton mill workers, so here also cotton mill workers come with Mahatma Gandhi and demand against the owners that there should be proper wages get wages, their working hours are not fixed and they are successful in that too And these are the early experiments of Satyagraha Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad And I have plotted Champaran, Kheda and Ahmedabad on the map Keep in mind what I have plotted on the map Why keep in mind what I have plotted on the map Because because it is three numbers, not three numbers, one number for sure, like this, one number for sure, understood, let's go. of 1918 tells that in 1918, Mahatma Gandhi used to go to Ahmedabad.
