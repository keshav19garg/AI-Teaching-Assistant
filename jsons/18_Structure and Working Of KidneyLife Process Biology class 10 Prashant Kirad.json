Kidneys are two bean-shaped organs found on the left and right side of the body that are responsible for filtering blood, removing waste, and controlling body fluids balance. This is a bean-shaped vein, which filters blood. Now, the entire process of the kidney is theoretically written here. For example, blood and waste enters through the renal artery.

This question was asked in the board exam of 2024 in which this question was asked that why and how urine is produced What is the need and how? How is urine being made and what is the need for it? So first of all, why urine is produced? Rid of harmful metabolic waste. with the help of your kidneys. Okay, so this question was asked Why and how is urine produced? So remember, why? Why is it being made? Because all the metabolic wastes and toxic substances have to be removed. All the toxic things in life have to be removed from your life with time.

Chhota Miya is short for Chhota, but it is long for Kam. Think about it. Because it does so many functions that you can't even imagine. But today I will force you to think about it. And today I will explain it to you. Nephron is basically... Do you know that in one kidney, there are millions of nephrons? How many? Millions. Millions, you understand, right? There are more than 10 lakhs of nephrons. I mean, what's the size? It's a very small size. But its work is very important. Why?

Who is it? It is nephron. Next thing. Responsible for filtration of blood? There are minerals of... Millions of nephrons present in each kidney. Very good. I understood this much. Now you can see this diagram. This is NCRT diagram. Let's zoom it a little. You can see this diagram. And you must be thinking that brother, tell me one thing, what is this diagram? This will not be asked. Brother, what is happening here? I would like to apologize for saying that this diagram can be asked. Yes. In the board exam, the question has not been asked directly yet. But it is asked in the school exams. It is asked in the Huffield exam. So first of all, I would like to apologize. This is a dirty diagram. I am telling you this is a dirty diagram. It's a very simple diagram, isn't it? I totally agree with you. But it can be asked, how to do it? Practice it. Only then you will be able to learn how to make this diagram. Now, let's understand its function one by one. Nephron filters blood in three steps. In how many steps? In three steps. I'll explain those three steps. Listen carefully. If you understand these three steps today, you'll never have a problem with nephron for the rest of your life. Listen to this. Okay? This is a topic that kids skip in school. No one understands it. But you'll understand it at once. Come on. Look. Blood came. Where does the blood come from? From the artery. Blood came from the artery to the kidney and from the kidney to the nephron. As soon as the blood comes in, the younger man says, I will welcome you. So the blood asks, how will you welcome me? So this younger man, He replies, I have a capsule, a capsule which I call Bowman's Capsule. What do I call it? Bowman's Capsule. Okay, so the blood says you won't welcome us. So what is he saying? Of course we will welcome you. How will we welcome you? We will welcome you with the help of Bowman's Capsule. So you can see a capsule-like structure. This is Bowman's Capsule and it has a spiral structure called Glomerulus. and it's spelling will be written as GLOMERULOUS ok so blood came blood said you won't welcome us so little boy said of course we will with the help of Bowman Capsule so what does it do in its Bowman Capsule the blood that is coming that blood in its Bowman Capsule collects it ok, collects it now in Bowman Capsule Understand it very carefully. He is not a small man, he is a complex man. Listen to me. Look, Bowman Capsule. You understand capsule, right? Structure, capsule. He must have been shot. Okay. Now, now. This Bowman Capsule was a very cunning thing. Do you know what he did with the blood? Blood came. All the impurities of the blood Sorry for all the impurities, he pulled them out. I mean, the Bowman capsule worked as a vacuum. What does a vacuum do? It pulls it out. By the way, all the impurities were thrown back. Look, all the impurities were thrown back. Okay? The blood was shocked. The blood said, sorry for all the impurities. Man! You are a great human being, then the blood says, okay, you have taken all the impurities, now I am leaving, remember me in your prayers. So the younger husband also said, okay, you go, I will remember you in my prayers. Now the blood started coming out of here, see, the blood started coming out and all the impurities came here. Okay, now the blood was going happily, happily, happily, happily, and it was going ahead. blood suddenly remembers, oh brother, I was scammed, I was scammed, do you know how? This Jhota Mia, this Bowman Capsule, do you know what it did? It along with impurities, all the good particles, like glucose. undigested glucose or you can say fatty acids, etc. All the good particles were taken from the blood and a lot of water was also taken out. So the blood remembered that I had a scam. I have taken good particles and also took glucose. So the blood got angry. The blood said to the young man, I will return your particles to you, no problem. So blood said, how will you return? Listen carefully. Blood said, how will you return? So, what did younger brother say? Younger brother said to blood, you come back. You, what do you do? Look carefully. What did he say to the blood? He told the blood to come back. Can you see this? He told the blood. The blood was going its own way. But he told the blood to come back. Come back. Now, these loops that you can see here. Do you know what these loops are? Here, there is reabsorption. Now, I will make you write the points one by one. Now, you will understand. What happened in the first step? All the water... and took all the things. Later, the blood realized that I was cheated, so the blood went back. When the blood went back, what happened? Reabsorption. All the good things came back to the blood. All the good things like glucose, fatty acid, all of that came back to the blood. Now the blood is happy. Yes, man, now I have everything. Okay. Now I have everything. So what does blood do? Blood circulates from here to here and from here it goes back to its home. Blood circulates from here to here and from here it goes back to its home. And what does chotamiya do? What does nephron do? Nephron throws all the impurities in a tube. In which? In a tube which we call collecting duct. Means a tube which collects all the impurities. We call it collecting duct. So all the impurities are thrown into the collecting duct. And what does the collecting duct do? It sends all the impurities to the ureter. What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? Tell me quickly. Now listen to one thing again. Don't write anything now. Now listen again. What was the story? The story was of Chhote Mian and Blood. Blood came to Chhote Mian that brother clean me. So Chhote Mian said that we will welcome you with whom? With Bowman Capsules. Bowman Capsules! The woman's capsule contained glomerulus, which is a spiral structure. The woman's capsule removed all the impurities from the capsule. The blood was going back to normal. The blood remembered that everything was fine with it. The woman took good things along with the impurities, like glucose. He said, you did wrong, give it back to me. So the blood comes back and says, give me my things back. So the young man said, don't worry. You come to us, we will give you back. So what does the blood do? All the things that were good, like glucose, it absorbs them back into the blood. Okay. Then the blood comes out again. All the impurities get trapped in the collecting duct. Where? In the collecting duct. What you are seeing is the collecting duct. You have to remember this process in three steps. The first step is Glomerular Filtration. I have explained the whole procedure to you. You just remember the terms. The first term is Glomerular Filtration. The first term is Glomerular Filtration. What is this? I told you about it, right? All the blood has been filtered in the Bowman's Capsule. The first step is Glomerular Filtration. Next step is Glomerular Filtration. Note down quickly.

I don't know how other teachers teach you, all of them are good, but there are a lot of teachers who teach you from the perspective of biology. And you think that these teachers will teach us everything, right? But they are making you do it. I just want you to learn to love the subject. Learn to understand. Learn to understand through stories. Okay? Let's go. The first one is Glomerular. So this was our first step. What was the second step? Selective reabsorption. What is reabsorption? Absorbing things again. And who used to do this? The one who used to turn his back and see that I have been cheated. I have been scammed. I have been scammed. I have been scammed. I have been scammed. I have been scammed. I have been scammed. Now, when I have a scam, I will take back all the good things in my blood. That process is called selective reabsorption. Useful substances like glucose, amino acids, salt and major amount of water from the filtrate are reabsorbed back by capillaries surrounding the nephron. Okay. What do we do? and reabsorbs it from the nephron. All useful things. Clear? Last is tubular secretion. What is this? All important waste products are stored in the collecting duct. Urea, extra water, and salts are secreted the tubule which open up into the collecting duct and where will it go from the collecting duct? Where will it go from the collecting duct, tell me brother, where will it go? It will go to the ureter, ureter, urinary bladder, urethra, do you remember? So these are our three steps, okay? Remember the names of the three steps. 1. Glomerular Filtration 2. Selective Reabsorption 3. Tubular Secretion Try to practice this diagram once. See, the diagram of nephron has not come in the board till date. If it comes in the school exam, I can't say. Everyone's school paper is different. The diagram of nephron has not come in the board till date. But, because it is in NCRT, we will never get it out of syllabus. This is why I say that you will understand the diagram if you practice it once or twice. So, this was the story of our kidneys. So, this was a small diagram of our kidneys. I have already told you what are kidneys. Kidneys have nephrons. Nephron filters the blood Blood is filtered and goes to the ureter Ureter to urinary bladder What does urinary bladder do? It stores the urine And last is urethra Through which we take out the urine can write in your own language. Writing is not everything. It is important to understand from stories. What is my main job?
