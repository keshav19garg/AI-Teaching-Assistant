Now this diagram, you can consider this to be the most important diagram in the world, because according to me, this is the most important diagram of the entire NCRT. I will try to explain it to you with a few simple things, What is a hut? Let's understand a hut in a simple way. In a hut, there are 4 chambers. Let's say you have 4 rooms in your house. In the same way, there are 4 rooms in a hut, which we call 4 chambers. What do we call 4 chambers? First, I divided my hut into two parts. Left side, right side. Left side, right side. And I also divided the left side into two parts. The first part is my left atrium. And the lower part is left ventricle. See, what did I do? Divide it into two parts, left and right. Now, I have divided the left one into two parts. I called the upper one as left atrium. I called the lower one as left ventricle. Catch is clear? Similarly, I have divided the right one into two parts. Upper one is right atrium. Lower one is right ventricle. Okay? Clear? It's clear till here. What did I do? Assume I had a heart. I had a cute little heart. What did I do? First, I divided it into left and right. Then what did I do? I made another line in the middle. And I said, what will be the upper one? The upper one will be my atrium. And what will be the lower one? Ventricle. Okay. Okay. So, the atrium is the upper one. the lower ventricle. And remember one thing, in some books, in reference books, atrium is also called as auricle. Auricle. Auricle is also called as auricle. If you see auricle anywhere, then don't get confused. Oh, I didn't tell you this. Auricle is nothing. Auricle is atrium. Atrium is called as auricle. The story of blood. Listen. What happened? From the lungs, from the lungs, oxygenated blood used to come towards the heart. Pulmonary vein. Who used to come? Pulmonary vein. Do you remember this story? Pulmonary vein. Pulmonary vein used to come with oxygenated blood. Where? On the left side. Now see, in the upper part of the left side, blood enters first. Blood comes, comes, comes, comes, enters the left side. What happens in the left side is that our blood enters. What happens in the left side is that our blood enters. ok entered is in the atrium Atrium pushes the bulb down to the left ventricle to the left ventricle left atrium down from atrium to ventricle and what ventricle does is it pushes the blood to the right ventricle by the help of aorta. It will be confusing. If you don't pay attention, it will be confusing. Left atrium, left ventricle. Aorta. Body organ comes back from aorta. With whose help? With the help of vena dava. It comes back to the right atrium. The right atrium sends down the right ventricle and the right ventricle sends out to the lungs by the help of pulmonary artery. So this is a complete cycle. We have already studied this cycle. There are four chambers in the heart, left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium, right ventricle. So there are chambers up and down, don't get confused. First blood comes up, then it goes down, then it goes out. Now this is the cycle in our diagram. You should know how to make this diagram. This diagram is important. You can see that the blood came from the pulmonary vein. The upper part is the left atrium. The lower part is the left ventricle. What happened to the left ventricle is that the blood pushed outwards. left ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle and then it came out. Now it came back from the body. It came back from the body with the help of vena cava. This is vena cava from lower body. This is vena cava from upper body. Vena cava from upper body. There are two types of vena cava. One comes from upper body and other from lower body. So, vena cava comes from lower body and vena cava comes from upper body. Both come and meet in the right atrium. Where? In the right atrium. You can see where they are meeting. In the right atrium. Clear? In the right atrium. pushes the right ventricle and the right ventricle pushes to send it out. See, this blood went out by the help of pulmonary artery. Okay? Clear? Clear? Now, there is one thing to understand in this. This wall that you can see, which is dividing, This wall is called a septum. And you can see that the heart is tilted to the left. you have to take a rough page take a rough page and make a box on the rough page take a rough page and make a box on it divide it in 4 chambers divide it in 4 chambers now you have to recall what I have told you recall it quickly that this is my left this is my left atrium this is my left ventricle This is our right atrium, this is our right ventricle, which one brings blood here, then the blood goes here, then it goes out with the help of the aorta, then it comes back, then it is like this in the lung.

Think about it once. What can be done? Right? Kids think, okay, let's go to Google. First think about it once. Why is this happening? Because there is a reason behind everything.
