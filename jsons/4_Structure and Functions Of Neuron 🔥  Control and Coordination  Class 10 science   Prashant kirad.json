So what is the basic and functional unit? Neuron. Neuron is the largest cell of the human body. The length of a neuron can be up to 1 meter. Do you know how much 1 meter is? It is the largest cell of the human body. The length of a neuron can be up to 1 meter. Let's say you touched some hot water or a bottle. What do you have in your hand? Do you have receptors? Come on, tell me your name. Let's play a quiz. Tell me your name. Which receptor will make me feel hot? Tell me the name of the receptor. Let's see. Let's see. Who has how much pain? Neuron will leave the signal to your brain and it will bring the signal back to your brain. This is the structure of neuron. You can understand what neuron does. We will do the labeling later.
