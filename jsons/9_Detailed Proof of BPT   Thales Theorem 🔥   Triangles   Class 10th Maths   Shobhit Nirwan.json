  "full_text": "Basic Proportionality Theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of triangle, then it divides the two sides in same ratio. So, what is being said? Given is a triangle. Look carefully. Suppose there is a triangle ABC. In this triangle, we are given a line parallel to any side BC. DE is parallel to BC, so what we have to prove, we have to prove BPT Basic Proportionality Theorem that AD upon DB. We have to prove that ae upon ec is equal to ae upon ec, because in the first lecture, we have already proved that if we know this, then we can add plus 1 to it. So we have to prove this. Watch carefully, this is a very good proof. Be careful Let's come to the proof Be careful I want your focus to be here for 5 minutes You will understand everything Otherwise kids don't understand this proof And this proof comes in your CBSE Proof is asked in board exam Ok Watch It's not that I got some divine powers to prove it and I understood it. My master taught me, so I learned from him and understood. Today I am telling you, learn from me and understand. Don't think how it will come to your mind, how it will happen, how it will happen. I also didn't understand like this from my childhood I understood from the teacher Today I am explaining to you So listen carefully with an open mind Look Assume We will do a construction We will do a construction We will do a construction Join join dc and eb we have done this construction that we have joined dc and eb ok now see carefully let's come to the proof proof will be in two parts see What I will do once, I will take this triangle and this triangle with it. Now I am lifting these two triangles. Look carefully, it will be in two parts. In the first part, I will take this triangle and this triangle. So the first part is lifting these two triangles. Then in the second part, I will take this one and then this one. So in the second part, we will take these two. So if we talk about the first part, then I am taking two triangles. Look carefully, I am taking two triangles. One is this triangle. The other triangle is ADE. And one is this triangle, which is below it. Look carefully, this one. One is this triangle. Which one? D, E, B. I am taking these two triangles. Very good. Assume, assume, assume, I have written the area of these two triangles. I have written the area of both these triangles. And I am assuming the base to be this side. The sides here and here. I am keeping my eyes here. Suppose these are my eyes here. These are my eyes here. And I have kept my eyes from here. So, this will be the base for me. I am assuming the one below to be the base. So, this is the base below. And if I see from here, this is the base of this triangle. So who did I consider as the base? I considered this side as the base. Keep watching carefully. What will be the area of this triangle? Area of triangle ADE will be half into base of triangle AD into height I will write something. Similarly, area of this triangle Area of triangle BDE And I will consider the base as BD If I consider this as the base, then the height will be perpendicular to the opposite vertex of the base. So what did I do? I put a perpendicular from here. From the opposite vertex of the base, a perpendicular is added. Suppose, this is e,p. So, perpendicular becomes e,p. Similarly, in the case of this triangle, the base is e,p. BD is considered to be the base, so perpendicular to the opposite vertex of the base is also EPE. Yes, the perpendicular is coming out of the triangle, but it is also outside, so we can also say that it is also EPE. So its perpendicular is also EPE. So, in the upper triangle, I have written half into base into height and in the lower triangle, I have written half into base into height. I have taken this as first and this as second. If I divide first by second, EP and EP will be cut, half and half will be cut. Are you able to understand? If I divide these two, then half and half will be cut and EP and EP will be cut. What is left? See, am I writing right? If I divide these two, then what will be left? Area of triangle. Area of triangle ADE upon area of triangle BDE will be equal to AD upon BDE Because remaining will be cut. AD upon BDE. So remaining will be cut. We call it A. The first second is done, we call it A. We call it A number equation. I will tell you, you will understand. What we did? I am telling you again, see carefully. We took this And took this Okay, took this and took this Wrote the area of \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039both of them Divided the area When divided, it was cut in half EP was cut from EP So ADE upon BDE is equal to AD upon BD Wrote this It is clear It is clear Very good Now what will we do in this part? What will we do in the second part? Watch carefully This is ABC and this was DE. Now what we will do? We will take these two triangles.  This triangle and this triangle. We will write the area of these two. Look carefully. We took this triangle ADE And this is ADE. And from here, we took this triangle. Which one? C, D, E. Okay? And we kept our eyes here. Your eyes are on this side. So, this will be the base for me. A, E and E, C will be the base. This will be the base. Now, the sides here and here will be the base. The sides here and here will be the base. If I write area of triangle ADE, it will be half into base of AE into height. If I write area of triangle DEC or CED, it will be half into base of ED or CE. Base of CE. This CE is considered to be the base because our eyes are from this side. If you are looking from this side, then this is the base and this is the base. What will be the height? The height is the height which is considered to be the base. The height is perpendicular to the opposite vertex of the base. So, I dropped the perpendicular from the opposite vertex of the base. This dq is the height. I dropped the perpendicular from the opposite vertex of the base and dq is the height. Similarly, what will happen for this? I dropped the perpendicular from the opposite vertex of the base. So, that perpendicular will also be dq. Watch carefully. In this case also, this triangle will be perpendicular to the opposite vertex of the base, which is dq So, this will also be perpendicular to dq Let's say this is 3rd and this is 4th If we divide 3rd and 4th, what will happen? 3rd divided by 4th If we do the fourth step, we will get area of triangle ADE upon area of triangle CED This is equal to AE upon CEK This is equal to sec B We call this as B number equation. Keep watching carefully. What we have to prove? We have to prove AD upon DB is equal to AE upon EC. We have to prove AD upon BD is equal to AD upon BC. So we have to prove that AD upon BD is equal to AE upon EC. So we have to somehow equal this A equation and this B equation. This A equation is required for this side and for this side also. If you want to make RHS equal to both, then LHS should be equal to both. In LHS, there is ADE in numerator and ADE in numerator. So numerator is equal. In denominator, there is BDE and ADE. Numerator is same, ADE, ADE. Numerator is same. Difference in denominator. If denominator is also equal in some way, that we somehow tell this triangle's area and this triangle's area equally, then denominator will also be equal. The LHS of both will be equal and the problem will be solved. There is a concept which we have studied in our childhood. What? Two triangles having same base and between same parallel lines. If two triangles have same base and same parallel lines, then their area will be same. If two triangles have same base and same parallel lines, then their area will be same. The base of this triangle is DE and between same parallel lines, this is its parallel. So, these two triangles are coming between same base and same parallel lines. So, we will say, therefore, area of triangle BDE will be equal to area of triangle BDE. C, E, D. What will be the area of these two? It will be equal. This is called the C-number equation. This is called the C-number equation. This is called the C-number equation. These two triangles, this triangle and this triangle, have the same base. This is the C-number equation. and between parallel lines DE parallel to BC is a given DE parallel to BC is a given that's why their area is same numerator was same ADE and ADE it was same we made denominator same The area of A, B and C is equal to the area of A, B and C. So we can say that from A, B and C equation, This equation and this equation. From these three equations, So from, from, What is happening? So from A, B and C, we will say that LHS has become equal. LHS's numerator and denominator and its numerator and denominator are equal. So RHS will also be equal. aE upon bD will be equal to aE upon cEk, means aD upon bD will be equal to aE upon cEk, this is what we had to prove hence proved. This is what we had to prove that aD upon dB is equal to aE upon eC, this ratio we had to do, hence proved. Hence proved. Hence proved. Watch carefully. I am telling you again. It is easy. You just need to understand 2-3 things to understand this question. You should know how to write area of triangle. You have another theorem that same base and between parallel lines. parallel lines. You should know 2-3 things before this theorem, that's why it seems a little big. But if you do it yourself after the class, it will be done in 2 minutes. What have we done? Look carefully, what have we done? I will tell you what we have done. Take this area and this area. We took this area and this area and divided it by the area of both the sides of the triangle. So by dividing this, we got AD upon BD, this upon this. Then what did we do? Then we took this area and this area. When we took the area of these two and divided it, we got AE upon CE. We got AE upon CE. So when we divided the previous one, we got this upon this. When we divided this one, we got this upon this.  When we divided the area of these two, which one? We divided the area of this and this. So we got this upon this. Then when I divide this area by this area, I get this area by this area. So basically I had to equal this area by this area and this area by this area. So if I have to equal both LHS and RHS, then LHS should be equal. Then I saw that in LHS, In LHS, one side of the numerator is ADE and the other side of the numerator is ADE. So, I said that the numerators of LHS are equal. Now, we have to equate the denominator. How will the area of CED and BDE be equal? To equate the denominator, I said that there is a theorem. Theorem is that if same base and between same parallel lines, then area will be equal. So, the denominator which was attached between these two, that page is solved in equation C. So, we have written from A to C, AD upon BD, this upon this and this upon this. ok clear write it see it is being said that DE is parallel to AC DE is parallel to AC DE is parallel to AC DE is parallel to AC DE is parallel to AC DE is parallel to AC after seeing this much have you understood the concept? In which triangle BPT will be applied? Parallel is given. If parallel is given, then BPT will be applied. This is a very simple thing. If parallel is given, then BPT will be applied. BPT will be applied. This much is understood. But in which triangle will it be applied? This should also be understood. So the child understood that if this is its parallel. If this is its parallel. So which triangle will you get? It's a simple thing to get in this triangle It's a simple thing to get in this triangle So let's put BPT in this triangle Let's put BPT in this triangle Let's put BPT in this triangle So if we put BPT, then BE upon EC will be equal to BD upon DA Why did you write small upon small equal to small upon small? You could have taken the upper small pawn as big as the upper small pawn. You could have taken the lower small pawn as big as the lower small pawn. So how did you know that you will take the small pawn as small as the small pawn? I said, see what is written in the proof. He wants BE upon EC. What does he want in the final proof? He wants BE upon EC. So, it needs to be smaller than that, that's why I put the result of smaller upon smaller. See, there are three things in BPT. First, BPT will be applied, this should be known. First step. Listen carefully. I am telling you a very important thing. First of all, as soon as you see parallel, BPT will be applied, this is the first step, this should be understood. Now if BPT is applied, then in which triangle it will be applied? You should also understand that if this is its panel, then only one triangle is visible. So the second step is to find out the plot, in which plot, in which triangle BPT will be applied. Now BPT will be applied, this is understood. I will get a triangle from here that I have understood. But which one will be used for BPT? Small pawn will be used, upper small pawn will be used, lower small pawn will be used. This tells us what we need finally. We will get to know what we need finally from this. So BE upon EC was required. Means small pawn was required. So I put this. Now see. Now see, two more things are given as parallel. So if parallel is given, then BPT will be applied. Where will it be applied? In which plot? In which triangle? So DC is parallel to EP. See, DC is parallel to AP. So as soon as you see this, If you understand that this and this is parallel, then it will be in this plot, it will be in this triangle, it will be in this triangle, understood? So which triangle will it be in? The triangle will be in A, B, C, D It is important to write this, write in this too Which triangle did we put in this one? We have put it in A, C, B. Right? We have put it in A, C, B. Very good. So, we got to know that B, P, T will be applied. We got to know in which triangle it will be applied. Now, which B, P, T will be applied? Small bond will be applied, upper small bond. We will get to know that finally what is required. We need B, C upon C, P. See, this is B, C. So, bc upon cp will be equal to bd upon dA. Did you understand? So, this is also equal to bd upon dA and this is also equal to bd upon dA. So, from first and second, we will say that be upon ec is equal to bc upon cp. Hence Proof Write it Write it Do you remember? We are doing such questions a lot Do you remember? So there are 3 steps Simple simple 3 steps I have made it very easy for you Kids have a lot of confusion in big questions First of all, the bell rings in the mind that BPT will be applied. This is the first step because it is not known that BPT will be applied in the question, then what is the matter? How does it come to know? If it is parallel given, then BPT will be applied. 2nd step, identify the triangle and 3rd step, identify the BPT If you find out these three things, then the question will be solved. Then the question will be solved. be applied, this is understood. I will get a triangle from here that I have understood. But which one will be used for BPT? Small pawn will be used, upper small pawn will be used, lower small pawn will be used. This tells us what we need finally. We will get to know what we need finally from this. So BE upon EC was required. Means small pawn was required. So I put this. Now see. Now see, two more things are given as parallel. So if parallel is given, then BPT will be applied. Where will it be applied? In which plot? In which triangle? So DC is parallel to EP. See, DC is parallel to AP. So as soon as you see this, If you understand that this and this is parallel, then it will be in this plot, it will be in this triangle, it will be in this triangle, understood? So which triangle will it be in? The triangle will be in A, B, C, D It is important to write this, write in this too Which triangle did we put in this one? We have put it in A, C, B. Right? We have put it in A, C, B. Very good. So, we got to know that B, P, T will be applied. We got to know in which triangle it will be applied. Now, which B, P, T will be applied? Small bond will be applied, upper small bond. We will get to know that finally what is required. We need B, C upon C, P. See, this is B, C. So, bc upon cp will be equal to bd upon dA. Did you understand? So, this is also equal to bd upon dA and this is also equal to bd upon dA. So, from first and second, we will say that be upon ec is equal to bc upon cp. Hence Proof Write it Write it Do you remember? We are doing such questions a lot Do you remember? So there are 3 steps Simple simple 3 steps I have made it very easy for you Kids have a lot of confusion in big questions First of all, the bell rings in the mind that BPT will be applied. This is the first step because it is not known that BPT will be applied in the question, then what is the matter? How does it come to know? If it is parallel given, then BPT will be applied. 2nd step, identify the triangle and 3rd step, identify the BPT If you find out these three things, then the question will be solved. Then the question will be solved."
