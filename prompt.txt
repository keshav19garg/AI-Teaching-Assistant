    I have created a class 10th course and for that I have a teaching assistant. Here are video chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:
    {"video_number":{"304":"12","305":"12","303":"12"},"title":{"304":"Acids, Bases & Salts \u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00a5   Science   Chlor-Alkali Process   Prashant Kirad","305":"Acids, Bases & Salts \u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00a5   Science   Chlor-Alkali Process   Prashant Kirad","303":"Acids, Bases & Salts \u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00a5   Science   Chlor-Alkali Process   Prashant Kirad"},"start":{"304":"01:40","305":"02:00","303":"01:20"},"end":{"304":"02:00","305":"02:20","303":"01:40"},"text":{"304":"brine solution.","305":"Brine solution is NaCl plus H2O. This is brine solution. We could have written it directly that we are dissolving salt in water but no, we have to call it brine. Okay, we said brine solution. So we put brine solution in this beaker. What did we do? We put concentrated brine solution in this beaker.","303":"Hydrogen, Oxygen. So we are going to do a similar reaction here. What we are going to do is we are going to learn the step by step process one by one. And it is very simple and you will understand it in one go. What I am doing is I am taking a beaker and I am putting a solution inside that beaker. I named that solution, I named that solution, son."},"chunk_id":{"304":304,"305":305,"303":303}}
    Question: where in the course is brine solution taught
    User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in english in a human way (don't mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course. and at the end don't ask any question.
    Answer in HTML format.
    Rules:
    - Wrap video numbers in <strong>
    - Wrap timestamps in <span class="timestamp">
    - Use <ul><li> for multiple points
    - Do not add extra HTML classes
