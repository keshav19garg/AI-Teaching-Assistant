    I have created a class 10th course and for that I have a teaching assistant. Here are video chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:
    {"video_number":{"466":"18","74":"4","99":"5"},"title":{"466":"Structure and Working Of KidneyLife Process Biology class 10 Prashant Kirad","74":"Structure and Functions Of Neuron    Control and Coordination  Class 10 science   Prashant kirad","99":"Sexual vs Asexual Reproduction!   Class 10 Science   How Organisms Reproduce"},"start":{"466":"2:20","74":"2:20","99":"3:00"},"end":{"466":"2:40","74":"2:40","99":"3:20"},"text":{"466":"Rid of harmful metabolic waste.","74":"In 9th class, I taught you about Nucleus. Nucleus, right? So, what happens in the cell body? Your electrical signals come. Now, those electrical signals go ahead. Now, this is the cell body. And this is the tail of that neuron. Tail, right? This is also called axon. Let me show you further in labeling. This is also called axon. Now, from here, the signals go ahead.","99":"Mitosis, meiosis, if you have heard this term in 9th grade, if you haven't, just remember this term, mitosis, meiosis. Okay? Very good. One last point, large number of plants, not organisms. In asexual reproduction, a lot of organisms are produced in a very short time. Whereas in sexual reproduction, it takes a lot of time. Even in humans."},"chunk_id":{"466":466,"74":74,"99":99}}
    Question: Where in the course there is mention about metabolic waste?
    User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in english in a human way (don't mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course. and at the end don't ask any question.
    Answer in HTML format.
    Rules:
    - Wrap video numbers in <strong>
    - Wrap timestamps in <span class="timestamp">
    - Use <ul><li> for multiple points
    - Do not add extra HTML classes
