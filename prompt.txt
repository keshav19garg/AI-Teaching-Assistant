    I have created a class 10th course and for that I have a teaching assistant. Here are video chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:
    {"video_number":{"237":"10","222":"10","322":"12"},"title":{"237":"The Rise of Nationalism In Europe   SST   The French Revolution   Digraj Sir","222":"The Rise of Nationalism In Europe   SST   The French Revolution   Digraj Sir","322":"Acids, Bases & Salts \u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00a5   Science   Chlor-Alkali Process   Prashant Kirad"},"start":{"237":"5:20","222":"0:20","322":"07:40"},"end":{"237":"5:40","222":"0:40","322":"07:59"},"text":{"237":"In France, there was a Jacobin club, I studied in 9th class. Jacobin clubs started getting established in different countries. There was a French army, French revolutionaries. They thought that it is your brother's responsibility that this idea of liberty, equality, justice, okay? These ideas of democratic government should spread all over Europe. And, when the time came","222":"of liberty, equality, justice. These ideas of democratic government should spread in the whole of Europe. Ok. Let's leak it.","322":"NEAR TO CATHODE Where is it being made? NEAR TO CATHODE NEAR TO CATHODE Questions like these come So how will they remember? With the help of a diagram If they understand the diagram Then they will understand the whole concept"},"chunk_id":{"237":237,"222":222,"322":322}}
    Question: where do i get some info regarding europe in the course
    User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in english in a human way (don't mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course. and at the end don't ask any question.
    Answer in HTML format.
    Rules:
    - Wrap video numbers in <strong>
    - Wrap timestamps in <span class="timestamp">
    - Use <ul><li> for multiple points
    - Do not add extra HTML classes
