I have created a class 10th course and for that I have a teaching assistant. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:
{"video_number":{"102":"5","497":"18","322":"12"},"title":{"102":"Sexual vs Asexual Reproduction!   Class 10 Science   How Organisms Reproduce","497":"Structure and Working Of KidneyLife Process Biology class 10 Prashant Kirad","322":"Acids, Bases & Salts \u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00a5   Science   Chlor-Alkali Process   Prashant Kirad"},"start":{"102":"4:00","497":"12:40","322":"07:40"},"end":{"102":"4:20","497":"13:00","322":"07:59"},"text":{"102":"Because there are two parents here. So what will happen here? What will happen here? Variation. Do you understand? What will happen here? Variation. And when there is variation, Whenever there is variation, Remember, what happens because of variation? What happens because of variation? Variation is important.","497":"I don't know how other teachers teach you, all of them are good, but there are a lot of teachers who teach you from the perspective of biology. And you think that these teachers will teach us everything, right? But they are making you do it. I just want you to learn to love the subject. Learn to understand. Learn to understand through stories. Okay? Let's go. The first one is Glomerular.","322":"NEAR TO CATHODE Where is it being made?

With the help of a diagram If they understand the diagram Then they will understand the whole concept"},"chunk_id":{"102":102,"497":497,"322":322}}
Question:  where are something related to parents taught
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (don't mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course. and at the end don't ask any question.
